This repository contains Project Three Grocery Store and Working with Files. 
Working with files is a completed program that converts temperatures between 
Fahrenheit and Celsius using a second text file. As my second program, I
uploaded the mainGrocery file, but I was unable to complete it. The program
is meant to have the ability to print and display frequencies as well as 
search through and extract items from text files. I'll finish this program soon,
and it should be working.
